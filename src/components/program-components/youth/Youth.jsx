        <h1>Youth Development</h1>
        <p>
          The Kenya Red Cross Society (KRCS) prioritizes youth engagement by
          establishing a Youth Development Department with the main goal of
          supporting youth to lead positive change in their communities.
          Focusing on thematic areas such as governance and leadership, youth
          livelihood and economic empowerment, peacebuilding and conflict
          prevention, protection of life and health, and youth climate action.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          KRCS seeks to develop strong young leaders as role models and
          catalysts for positive change in the governance and leadership sector.
          The goal of the Youth Livelihood and Economic Empowerment initiative
          is to improve young peopleâ€™s abilities to support themselves
          sustainably. Training in conflict resolution and advocacy via a
          variety of platforms are aspects of peacebuilding and conflict
          prevention.{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The Protection of Life & Health program focuses on mental health,
          sexual reproductive health, and basic first aid. Youth Climate Action
          aims to create an ecosystem for young people to thrive amidst the
          climate crisis. In schools, KRCS promotes globalization, innovation,
          and technology through Red Cross Clubs and Chapters, aligning with
          Ministry of Education policies and Sustainable Development Goals
          (SDGs).{" "}
        </p>
        <p>
          The organization has established 24 youth centers across counties to
          champion innovation and problem-solving while providing safe spaces
          for youth participation. The Empawa Stude program, developed during
          the COVID-19 pandemic, focuses on holistic development through
          teleconferencing and self-paced learning for adolescents aged 10-18.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Wema Platform serves as a digital volunteer platform, enabling
          Kenyan youth to sign up for various opportunities based on their
          interests, expertise, and availability. Overall, KRCS is dedicated to
          nurturing the potential of young people and fostering positive change
          in communities.
